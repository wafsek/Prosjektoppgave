/**
 * This package provides classes used for generating data, specifically the
 * ones in its parent package, {@link baminsurances.data}.
 * <p>
 * Some of the classes use external resources to generate data, and will not
 * function properly if these are missing. Therefore, make sure the folder
 * 'generator_resources' remains present and untouched.
 * <p>
 * This package should only exist in test versions of the software, as it has
 * no use in a real life situation.
